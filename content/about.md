## About Me

I am a Full-Stack Data Scientist with a Master of Science in AI & Machine Learning and certified expertise in Azure. With rich experience in diverse areas of Machine Learning, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Generative AI, I am dedicated to using AI to solve challenging business problems and create value.

Currently, I work at Amazon, where I oversee and optimize the operations of Amazon Robotics, ensuring efficient functioning and resolving critical issues promptly. Before Amazon, I worked at TATA Consultancy Services (TCS) as a Senior ML Engineer, leading end-to-end AI/ML solutions for global clients in the Travel, Transportation, and Hospitality sectors. My projects ranged from optimizing last-mile logistics and enhancing parcel distribution accuracy to developing personalized travel recommendation systems and AI-powered chatbots.

In my free time, I enjoy self-learning and development through online courses, hackathons, and personal projects, often publishing my work on platforms like Hugging Face and GitHub.
